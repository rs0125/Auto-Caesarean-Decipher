# Auto-Caesarean-Decipher
A program that automatically deciphers english text enciphered in caesar cipher via language recognition


## How it works
The program is based on Caesar Cipher (similar to the one I had used in DiCipher)
The algorithm accepts a input text from the user as a string variable and then runs a singular letter shift on it.
